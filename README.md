# Training App - A Flutter Aplication

This is flutter app for Training App development using a complex UI with getx package for navigation for android and ios from scratch. This would be a training or gym app ui.

## Major Sections


We have three complex ui sections in the app

- On the home page we have the container using different borders and the container itself contains other widgets both in row and column.
- On the home page we have two images on each other, like overlapping. and Images sizes are different.

- On the home we have two rows with two columns. In general in flutter we can not put two rows and columns next to each other. Two do that we used our own algorithms.
